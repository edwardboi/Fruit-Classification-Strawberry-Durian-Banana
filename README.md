# Fruit-Classification-Strawberry-Durian-Banana-

This project focuses on classifying fruits into three categories: Strawberry, Banana, and Durian. Using deep learning techniques, the system is built with three different architectures: ResNet, VGG16, and AlexNet. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of 100 images for each class.
